       " '\\n1 introduction  grammatical error correction (gec) is an interesting and challenging problem and the existing methods that attempt to solve this problem take recourse to deep linguistic and statistical analysis.\\nin general, gec may partly assist in solving natural language processing (nlp) tasks like machine translation, natural language generation etc.\\nhowever, a more evident application of gec is in building automated grammar checkers thereby benefiting non-native speakers of a language.\\nthe conll-2013 shared task (ng et al, 2013) looks at improving the current approaches for gec and for inviting novel perspectives towards solving the same.\\nthe shared task makes the nucle corpus (dahlmeier et al, 2013) available in the public domain and participants have been asked to correct grammatical errors belonging to the following categories: noun-number, determiner, subject-verb agreement (sva), verb form and preposition.\\nthe key challenges are handling interaction between different error groups and handling potential mistakes made by off-theshelf nlp components run on erroneous text.\\nfor the shared task, we have addressed the following problems: noun-number, determiner and subject-verb agreement correction.\\nfor nounnumber and determiner correction, we use a classification based approach to predict corrections which is a widely used approach (knight and chander, 1994; rozovskaya and roth, 2010).\\nfor subject-verb agreement correction, we propose a new rule-based approach which applies a set of conditional rules to correct the verb group to ensure its agreement with its subject.\\nour system obtained a score of 11.03 on the official test set using the m2 method.\\nour sva correction system performs very well with a f-score of 28.45 on the official test set.\\nsection 2 outlines our approach to solving the grammar correction problem.\\nsections 3, 4 and 5 describe the details of the noun-number, determiner and sva correction components of our system.\\nsection 6 explains our experimental setup.\\nsection 7 discusses the results of the experiments and section 8 concludes the report.',\n",
       " '\\nin this paper, we presented a hybrid grammatical correction system which incorporates both machine learning and rule-based components.\\nwe proposed a new rule-based method for subjectverb agreement correction.\\nas future work, we plan to explore richer features for noun-number and determiner errors.',\n",
